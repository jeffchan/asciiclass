# Lab 7: Graph Analytics Using Giraph

*Assigned: Oct 24, 2013*

*Due: Tuesday Oct 31, 2013 12:59PM (just before class)*


The goal of this lab is for you to get experience _running_ graph queries on Giraph, the open-source counterpart
to Google's Pregel, and to understand the pros and cons of vertex-centric approach to graph analytics.
Check out the [Pregel](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1807167.1807184&coll=DL&dl=ACM&CFID=371018483&CFTOKEN=18422478)
paper for more details.

In this lab, you will work with the [LiveJournal dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-LiveJournal1.html),
which is a directed friendship graph from the LiveJournal website. You will run the PageRank and the ShortestPath statistics over this dataset.

Each line in the dataset represents an edge of the form `FromNodeId ToNodeId`in the friendship graph.
We have put these files on Amazon S3 at: `s3://6885public/livejournal/dataset.txt`


## Setup

You should create a micro-instance as you did in previous labs and ssh into your virtual machine (you can also run these commands from your own machine). Install the following packages.

### Data

You will use `tiny_graph.txt` to test your first Giraph program. It contains the following data:

````bash
[0,0,[[1,1],[3,3]]]
[1,0,[[0,1],[2,2],[3,1]]]
[2,0,[[1,2],[4,4]]]
[3,0,[[0,3],[1,1],[4,4]]]
[4,0,[[3,4],[2,4]]]
````

where each line is in JSON format as

	[vertexid, vertexvalue, [ [vertexid, edgeweight], ...] ]


### Start an Instance

You will need Giraph and Hadoop to run this lab.  Installing them is a pain, so we've created AMI images that you
can copy and use with minimal tweaks.  First, create an instance:

	aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <IMAGE_ID> --count 1 --instance-type m1.small --key-name <your key pair from lab6> --region <your region name from lab6>

`--key-name` from lab6 would be `sparklab-yourusername`.  You can go to "Key Pairs" in the aws console to check.

Depending on your region, the IMAGE_ID is

* `ami-aee4d3eb` for us-west-1
* `ami-a463fa94` for us-west-2
* `ami-995d01f0` for us-east-1

Make sure that your Amazon credentials are set up as in lab 6 or the `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable is set as in lab 5. It might take a few minutes to get the instance running. You can check the instance by logging in to [this link](https://6885.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) as in lab 6. Alternatively, you can use the ec2 tools as follows:

	aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <INSTANCE_ID>

Note the public DNS name of the newly launched instance and ssh into it.

	ssh -i <your keypair .pem file> ubuntu@<public hostname>

You will find the precompiled Giraph binaries in `~/giraph-1.0.0`.  Hadoop is in `~/hadoop/`.  The datasets are in `~/`.
Remember to terminate your instance once you are done as follows:

	aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <INSTANCE_ID>

<!--
### Set up Hadoop

Giraph runs on top of Hadoop/MapReduce. To run it we first need to setup Hadoop. We will first set up Hadoop in pseudo-distributed mode on a single instance.

	wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/core/hadoop-0.20.2/hadoop-0.20.2.tar.gz
	tar xzf hadoop-0.20.2.tar.gz
	mv hadoop-0.20.2 hadoop
	export HADOOP_HOME=~/hadoop
-->

#### Configuring Hadoop

<!--
Now we need to configure a bunch of properties.


First install Java 7:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64


Set the java home in $HADOOP_HOME/conf/hadoop-env.sh:

	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64

-->

You need to tell this Hadoop instance where it is, and setup password-less SSH so Hadoop can log into the nodes without
typing in a password.

Update `$HADOOP_HOME/conf/core-site.xml`. Replace `HOSTNAME` with the name (ec2-X-X-X-X.compute-..com)
of your instance.

	<property>
	<name>fs.default.name</name>
	<value>hdfs://HOSTNAME:9000</value>
	</property>

Update `$HADOOP_HOME/conf/mapred-site.xml` similarly -- replace `HOSTNAME` with the name of your instance.

	<property>
	<name>mapred.job.tracker</name>
	<value>HOSTNAME:9001</value>
	</property>

<!--
Now specify a temporary directory location and replication factor in $HADOOP_HOME/conf/hdfs-site.xml.
Since we are running in "pseudo-distributed mode", we just set the replication factor to 1.

	<property>
	<name>hadoop.tmp.dir</name>
	<value>/home/ubuntu/hadoopTmpDirectory</value>
	</property>

	<property>
	<name>dfs.replication</name>
	<value>1</value>
	</property>
-->

Finally, we need to setup passphrase-less access from the master to the slave node (The same node in this case).

	rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts
	rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa*
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""
	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

_Finally_, you can run Hadoop:

	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/start-all.sh

<!--
	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop namenode -format
	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/start-dfs.sh
	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/start-mapred.sh
-->

On successfully starting Hadoop, `jps` should show something like this (ignore the pids):

````bash
11576 SecondaryNameNode
11414 DataNode
11835 TaskTracker
11261 NameNode
11878 Jps
11679 JobTracker
````


#### Testing HDFS

Let's make sure HDFS works and has our `tiny_graph.txt` dataset

List files in HDFS

	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop dfs -ls

You should see a few files: `live.txt, tiny_graph.txt, ...`.  The first one is the livejournal dataset that
we pre-loaded into HDFS.  The second `tiny_graph.txt` has size zero, so let's re-upload it again.

Delete the file

	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop dfs -rm tiny_graph.txt

Copy it back in

	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop dfs -rm tiny_graph.txt

Now if you `-ls`, you should see that the file is not empty.

#### Creating a Cluster

Now you can spin up (between 1 - 7) instances and configure them.  Record their hostnames.

In order to add them to a cluster, pick one of your instances as the master and add the hostnames
to `~/hadoop/conf/slaves`.  One hostname per line.

Test this by

1. Stop Hadoop on all of the instances: `$HADOOP_HOME/bin/stop-all.sh`
2. Start hadoop on your master: `$HADOOP_HOME/bin/start-all.sh`
3. ssh to a slave and run: `jps`.  TaskTracker and DataNode should be running.

HDFS may be read-only for ~5 minutes while files are replicated.  Until then, you may get a
"Name node is in safe mode." error.



Hurray!


<!--
### Maven

We need Maven to build Giraph. Run the following.

	sudo apt-get install maven

If you see the installer complaining about `libwagon2-java` then run the folloowing and then try installing maven again.

	sudo dpkg -i --force-all /var/cache/apt/archives/libwagon2-java_2.2-3+nmu1_all.deb


### Giraph

Deploy Giraph as follows:

	wget http://apache.mirrors.pair.com/giraph/giraph-1.0.0/giraph-1.0.0.tar.gz
	tar xzf giraph-1.0.0.tar.gz
	mv giraph-1.0.0 giraph
	cd giraph
	mvn package -DskipTests -Phadoop_non_secure 0.20.2
	export GIRAPH_HOME=~/giraph
-->

## Running Giraph

#### Compile a program



#### Shortest Path Query

Run the query:

	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar \
	  ~/giraph-1.0.0/giraph-examples/target/giraph-examples-1.0.0-for-hadoop-0.20.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
	  org.apache.giraph.GiraphRunner\
	  org.apache.giraph.examples.SimpleShortestPathsVertex \
	  -vif org.apache.giraph.io.formats.JsonLongDoubleFloatDoubleVertexInputFormat\
	  -vip tiny_graph.txt \
	  -of org.apache.giraph.io.formats.IdWithValueTextOutputFormat \
	  -op shortestpathsOutput \
	  -w 1

The output files are in

	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop dfs -ls shortestpathsOutput/

We briefly describe the parameters above below;  for more details run GiraphRunner with the `-h` option:

* -vif	defines the vertex input format.  `JsonLongDoubleFloatDoubleVertexInputFormat` parses the input file format.
* -vip	provides the path of the vertex input file
* -of defines the output format
* -op provides the output path
* -w tells the number of workers (should be at most 1 less than the maximum number of map tasks)

For example code, look in the `~/giraph-1.0.0/giraph-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/giraph/examples` directory.

#### PageRank Query

Now implement  PageRank using Giraph. You will need to write the `compute` function.
For reference, you can have a look at the example PageRank implementation in
Giraph [here](https://github.com/apache/giraph/blob/release-1.0/giraph-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/giraph/examples/SimplePageRankVertex.java).

You will run PageRank on the LiveJournal dataset, which is not in the `tiny_graph.txt` format.
Instead, each line is simply a `startvertexid  endvertexid` pair.  You can handle this in either of two ways:

1. Pre-process the data file and convert it into the JSON format, or
2. Modify the vertex/edge input formats to parse the input data accordingly.


#### Fully Distributed Mode (Optional)

Launch 10 instances on ec2 and install/configure Hadoop on all of them (one way is to create an AMI image of
an instance with hadoop installed and call `aws ec2 run-instances` with that image).  Then you will need to

* Start Hadoop on all of the instances
* Add the slave machines' hostnames (ec2-x-x...amazon.com) to the master node's `~/hadoop/conf/slaves` file.
  One hostname per line
* On the master node.  Terminate everything (`~/hadoop/bin/stop-all.sh`) and start everything up (`~/hadoop/bin/start-all.sh`).

Sanity check by rerunning on `tiny_graph.txt`

Finally, re-run  PageRank on 10 instances.

### Questions

* List the vertex ids of the top 10 PageRanks.
* How did you handle the LiveJournal input file?
* Qualitatively compare the PageRank implementation in Giraph with the PageRank implementation in:
	* Hadoop
	* Spark
* What are the pros and cons of vertex-centric computation model?
