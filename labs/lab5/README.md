# Lab 5: Hadoop/Elastic-Map-Reduce

*Assigned: Oct 1, 2013*

*Due: Tuesday Oct 8, 2013 12:59PM (just before class)*

The goal of this lab is for you to get experience _running_ Hadoop/MapReduce jobs on AWS, both to understand
the pros and cons of using Hadoop, and as a setup for the next series of labs.  

In this lab, you will work with the [enron email corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/), which contains the email contents of all high level employees during the [Enron fiasco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal).  You will compute simple and _slightly more_ complicated statistics.

A sample of the data is below:

````json
{"bccnames": [], "sender": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "tonames": [""], "cc": [], "text": "Here is our forecast\n\n ", "recipients": ["tim.belden@enron.com"], "mid": "18782981.1075855378110.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "ctype": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "bcc": [], "to": ["tim.belden@enron.com"], "replyto": null, "names": [], "ccnames": [], "date": "2001-05-14 16:39:00-07:00", "folder": "_sent_mail", "sendername": "", "subject":     ""}    
{"bccnames": [], "sender": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "tonames": [""], "cc": [], "text": "Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  ...", "recipients": ["john.lavorato@enron.com"], "mid": "15464986.1075855378456.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "ctype": "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "bcc": [], "to": ["john.lavorato@enron.com"], "replyto": null, "names": [], "ccnames": [], "date": "2001-05-04 13:51:00-07:00", "folder": "_sent_mail", "sendername": "", "subject": "Re:"}
````

The dataset is stored as a set of files, where each file contains all emails sent by one person.  We have put these files on Amazon S3 at: `s3://6885public/enron/*.json`

## Setup

You should create a micro-instance as you did in previous
labs and ssh into your virtual machine (you can also run these commands from your own machine).    Install the following packages.

### Data



Decompress `lay-k.json.gz`, which you will use to test your first mapreduce program:

````bash
gzip -d lay-k.json.gz
````

### Python

You will need to install the following packages:

````bash
pip install mrjob
pip install awscli
````    
    
[mrjob](http://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/) makes managing and deploying map reduce jobs from Python easy.

[awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) provides convenient command line tools for managing AWS services (e.g., copying data to and from S3)

    aws s3 cp <local file> s3://6885public/YOURDIRECTORY/
    
(6885public is an Amazon bucket we have created for the class.)

<!--
### Amazon

[Go to this website](https://6885.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)
and login with the username `6885student` to create your own access
key (we will give you the password on Piazza and in class).

Then navigate to the [IAM
service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#users) and create
a new access key for yourself.  You will need this to interact with
AWS.

(We are going to let everyone use the same AWS account and see how well
that works!)
-->

#### Setup for Amazon Command Line Tools (awscli)

Amazon command line tools (awscli) provides simple commands for communicating
with AWS services.  You will use it to list, upload and download data
from their storage service, S3.

[Setup awscli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) by creating a config file containing the following (the region=us-east-1 is important)

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = AKIAJFDTPC4XX2LVETGA
    aws_secret_access_key = <secret key from piazza>
    region = us-east-1

    [preview]
    emr=true

Note that everyone in the class will be using the same secret key, which is posted on Piazza.

Now export the `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable, as follows:

    export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=<location of config file>

Now using `awscli` should work.  Try to list your buckets:

    aws s3 ls

#### Setup for mrjob

[Setup mrjob](http://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/guides/emr-quickstart.html#amazon-setup) by creating `~/.mrjob.conf` with:

    runners:
      emr:
        aws_access_key_id: AKIAJFDTPC4XX2LVETGA
        aws_secret_access_key: <secret key from piazza>
        aws_region: us-east-1
        ec2_instance_type: m1.small
        
These will set your mrjob default parameters.  Please use `m1.small` instances.


## Running MapReduce locally

Before running a job on multiple servers, it's useful to debug your map reduce job locally (on your own micro-instance or home machine).

`mr_wordcount.py` contains the following code to count the number of times each term (word) appears
in the email corpus:

````python
import sys
from mrjob.protocol import JSONValueProtocol
from mrjob.job import MRJob
from term_tools import get_terms

class MRWordCount(MRJob):
    INPUT_PROTOCOL = JSONValueProtocol
    OUTPUT_PROTOCOL = JSONValueProtocol

    def mapper(self, key, email):
        for term in get_terms(email['text']):
            yield term, 1

    def reducer(self, term, occurrences):
        yield None, {'term': term, 'count': sum(occurrences)}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MRWordCount.run()
````


First, run this locally on `lay-k.json`
            
````bash
python mr_wordcount.py -o 'wordcount_test' --no-output './lay-k.json'
````

The output should be in `wordcount_test/` and should look like:

````json
{"count": 33, "term": "aapl"}
{"count": 2, "term": "aarhus"}
{"count": 8, "term": "aaron"}
{"count": 1, "term": "aarp"}
{"count": 1, "term": "ab-initio"}
{"count": 20, "term": "abandon"}
````

Be cool, test locally before deploying globally (on AWS)!
</div>


## An Important Note!

In the following parts of the lab you will run on multiple EMR nodes on Amazon.  This starts to cost actual money, and the class has a finite budget for AWS usage so please be **VERY CAREFUL**.  Keep the following in mind when deploying on AWS:

* Amazon rounds up to the nearest hour each time you spin up machines.  So if you run 2 separate jobs that spin up 10 machines each and only run 5 minutes each, then it costs 2x10 hours.
* When you run a job, `mrjob` will give it an id (e.g., j-12BOETECEU8). **Record this id!!**
* If you are going to run a bunch of jobs, create a job pool so that subsequent jobs can reuse previously allocated machines.
* **When you are done, ALWAYS TERMINATE YOUR JOB FLOWS**

        mrjob audit-emr-usage    # lists your job flows at the bottom
        mrjob terminate-job-flow <ID OF JOB FLOW>
        mrjob audit-emr-usage    # jobs should be SHUTTING_DOWN, TERMINATED, COMPLETED

* If you have any questions please [read the mrjob documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/guides/emr-tools.html#module-mrjob.tools.emr.create_job_flow) and post on Piazza.

As a precaution, we will periodically run the following command

    mrjob terminate-idle-job-flows




## Running on EMR


Now let's run the same script on the same file sitting on s3, `s3://6885public/enron/lay-k.json`:


````bash
python mr_wordcount.py  \
  --owner=YOURNAME \
  --num-ec2-instances=1 \
  --pool-emr-job-flows \
  --python-archive package.tar.gz \
  --s3-scratch-uri='s3://6885public/YOURDIRECTORY/scratch' \
  -r emr \
  -o 's3://6885public/YOURDIRECTORY/output' \
  --no-output \
  's3://6885public/enron/lay-k.json'
````      

Some details about executing this:

* A job-flow simply means the set of machines that have been allocated for a "job".
* `--owner` given the job's owner a name.  Helps you and us identify job owners.  Set it to your name or alias.
* `--num-ec2-instances` specifies the number of machines.  Please use less than 10 machines
* `--pool-emr-job-flows` re-uses an existing job-flow if one exists.  Otherwise it creates a new job-flow and keeps the allocated machines around after the job ends for future jobs using this flag.  Arguments such as `--num-ec2-instances` must be the same for a job-flow to be reused.  **This means you need to explicitly shut the pool down when you are done!!**
* `--python-archive` contains the gzip python files and packages that your job uses.
* `--s3-scratch-uri` is the folder where emr's temporary log files should be stored.
* Replace `YOURDIRECTORY` with a unique name.  AWS will automatically create the directory.
* `--no-output` suppresses outputs to STDOUT


You should be able to use awscli to download the file and check if the results are sane:

    aws s3 cp --recursive s3://6885public/YOURDIRECTORY/output . 

If so, it's probably safe to change the inputs to `s3://6885public/enron/*.json` and run again on `10` instances




## Your Task: TF-IDF

The goal of this section is to perform TF-IDF ("Term Frequency / Inter-Document Frequency") for each sender in the corpus.
You can read about [TF-IDF on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).    Wikipedia describes it as:
 
    a numerical statistic which reflects how important 
    a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.

TF-IDF is pretty general, and the definiton of "document" and "collection" varies depending on analysis.  Pick and describe whatever makes sense to compute the top terms for Enron's key people (see questions).
As an example, a "document" may be all text in all of a sender's
emails, and the "collection or corpus" could be the set of all emails in
the corpus.

To make things easy, the total number of emails is `516893`.

You will probably want to

1. Compute per-term IDFs
2. Join that with each sender's TFs

You can optionally do preprocessing of the documents, such as removing stop words (see [NLTK stopwords](https://www.google.com/search?q=nltk+stop+word)), stemming words, etc etc...



**Once again, please test locally before running globally!**


### Questions

* List the top TF-IDF terms for Enron's key people: 
    * Kenneth Lay, Founder, Chairman and CEO
    * Jeffrey Skilling, former President, and COO
    * Andrew Fastow, former CFO
    * Rebecca Mark-Jusbasche, former Vice Chairman, Chairman and CEO of Enron International
    * Stephen F. Cooper, Interim CEO and CRO
* How did you compute TF-IDF on the whole corpus?  What was easy, what was hard?


The `from` and `to,cc,bcc` fields in each email define directed edges (from --> to) between 
each person (node).  These edges form a graph.  

* Sketch a description of how you would use EMR to run [page rank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_rank) on this graph.  What would be some pain points?

Bonus question (optional):

* Cluster the senders by their TF-IDF vectors in whatever way you want.  Describe the clusters.  Who's close to whom?
