1. What is the message in your visualization and what techniques did you use to illustrate it?
The visualization I created is a heatmap. It tells the story of where Bostonian lives and work,
and how that changes over the course of the week. I implemented a selector to allow users to see
this progression.

2. If you used interaction or animation, how does it facilitate the user's understanding?
I implemented a weekday select to help the user understand the taxi pickup patterns
over the course of the week.

3. What format is the data that is used by the visualization? Is it the raw data or did you
need to compute some summary or derived data product?
The heatmap uses only the lat/long. I preprocessed the data so that it generated a count
summary by weekdays of the lat/long's with some rounding.
